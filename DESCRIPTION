Description: This package is a set of tools for processing course-level
    reports generated by Simon Fraser University's Student Evaluation 
    of Teaching and Courses (SETC) system. The course-level SETC reports
    are PDF files containing SETC results, formatting, graphics, etc. 
    The tools in this package can be used to extract the key data from
    these reports into data files that are usable for statistical 
    analysis.
